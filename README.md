# Logic with JS

Result of the challenge [7DaysOfCode - LÃ³gica com JavScript](https://7daysofcode.io/matricula/logica-programacao). Originally implemented in p5.js (wih no HTML and CSS) after just a few weeks of studies. 

Remade months later in CodePen, with HTML, CSS and DOM Manipulation, but still focused on vanilla JavaScript.

Composed of 7 individual challenges directed to testing and training basic concepts of programming.
